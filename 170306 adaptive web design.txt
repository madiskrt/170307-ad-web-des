THINK OF THE USER, NOT THE BROWSER:
Progressive enhancement - how to approach web design

Craft experiences that serve your users by giving them access to content without technol restrictions.

Fault tolerance, “forward compatible”
Graceful degradation - focused on making sure our site worked in modern browsers.

JavaScript must be written such that they can either recover from an error (perhaps by trying an alternate method of execution).

Progressive enhancement -  web technologies could be applied as layers that would build upon one another. your core focus is he content and everything builds upon that.

we have no way of knowing a particular user’s needs when they arrive on our site. Instead, we must rise to meet those needs

CHAPTER 2: PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT WITH MARKUP

class - classification (would contain a list of subclasses for the particular element they were applied to)

id - identification (identifying a specifc element on the page (this is why each id on a page needs to be unique))
